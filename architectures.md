## Telco Services

### Purpose
Contextually clever services that adapt to customer preferences along with geo-location into the mix improves operational efficiency. 

### Use Case
Telco service providers would like to be equipped with rich platform to reduce churn, launch new services on-demand, or create new revenue streams all in near real-time.

### Problem
Growing addition to network protocols, data formats, and the need to generate context specific customer outcomes in real-time is very challenging.

### Solution
The data-integration adapters in Spring XD allows subscription of various data sources. Equally seamless is to transform the individual payload into a desired data format. As the data is in transit, context specific data fragments can be computed through rich machine learning algorithms either through PMML models or via data processing engines such as Spark's MLLIb. Delegating the computation to Python is another alternative. 

### Outcome
Spring XD equips data scientists to collaborate seamlessly with Big Data Engineers and Application Developers.

## Health Care Services

### Purpose
Data from Historical health records, lifestyle and genetics â€“ all relevant to proactive study on possible outbreaks and to potentially use as patterns for diagnosis and treatments.

### Use case
Medical professionals would like to get access to historical data to combine with current patient vitals in order to diagnose and prescribe correct treatment procedures. Given that information is readily available, procedural challenges are now eliminated by having to quantify and qualify based on "actual" data points.

### Problem
Digital collection, storing and analysis of health records is cumbersome and equally challenging is protecting paitent health records.

### Solution
Data pipelines in Spring XD are designed to isolate data movement and at the same time protect the information through enterprise-grade security support through HTTPS, LDAP and Kerberos protocols. Collating data from various client endpoints (ex: medical implants, hospital devices, HL7 standards, clinical equipment), storing them in easily accessible data-marts, and running analytics to compute time-sensitive predictions can be done without the need of writing any code.

## Energy Services

### Use Case
Automation is critical for saving energy. Computerized electric utility grids yield immediate benefits through automated monitoring and management of connected-devices from a central location.

### Problem
Consuming data from various data devices is challenging and equally cumbersome is to make sense out of the data from historical trends on top of the real-time updates that pour in continuously.

### Solution
Spring XD allows automation through data-integration adapters that connect with sensor devices seamlessly. As the continuous data streams are in pipeline it can be orchestrated in Spring XD to pass through cleansing, transformation, analytics, or export to distributed file system such as Hadoop or a RDBMS. Energy services providers are now equipped with rich data platform to perform realistic predictions on usage patterns and as well as automatic deployment of crews based on outage alerts.

## Music Services

### Use Case
Growing music delivery platforms and trendy wearables are already disruptive; likewise, it creates room for more innovation and adds competitive advantage for the providers who are more data-centric.

### Problem
Attracting customers to a music platform by itself is one big challenge; retaining and engaging them with personalized services can get very complicated.

### Solution
Contexts derived from user preferences, interests and recommendations play a significant role in customer satisfaction. Continuous and consistent data analysis using Spring XD's stream pipelines could compute individual data-centric contexts; a context can be past listening trends, favorite music artist, rating on a album/song or it can be as simple as counter on song hit. Computations (contexts) are be persisted and reused inside and outside the platform through REST APIs thus allowing external interfaces such as wearables feeding into individual characteristics.

## Agriculture Services

### Use Case
Better crop quality and optimized yields lead to sustainable energy and stronger economy.

### Problem
Requires a single data-exchange platform that interconnects weather stations, seed and fertilizer suppliers, machinery providers, and laboratories.

### Solution
Creating a data-exchange platform in Spring XD is straightforward. A data-pipeline for each of the interlinked data-enabler allows easy subscription and collection of varied data sources. Allowing the pipelines to route the data into Hadoop and creating data 'mashup' for coherent predictive modeling and data analytics would enhance the overall agribusiness value chain.

## Airline Services

### Use Case
Data influenced business decisions allow airline service providers benefit from increased customer loyalty, revenue margins, efficient fares, ticketing and inventory management.

### Problem
Silos of data fragments that are tightly coupled in countless channels of data-enabling applications are hard to consume is one thing; using it is another.

### Solution
Spring XD makes it easy to consume structured and unstructured data. Robust data transformation add-ons assist with data cleansing and formatting for eventual consistency. Such meaningful array of data fragments is now available for various automation and analysis ranging from baggage carousel optimization to adjusting itinerary based on weather patterns or seasonal rush.
